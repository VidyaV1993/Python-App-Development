This web mapping app has two layers - volcanoes and population
- Volcano layer will display the volcanoes mentioned in the 'Volcanoes.txt' file with pop up window showing more details such as name, height etc.
- Population layer classifies the map in to different colors based on the population count in that region based on the info from "world.json" file.
