## App 1: Webmapping with Python

This is an interactive mapping with 2 layers - Volcanoes and Population
* Volcano layer will display the volcanoes mentioned in the 'Volcanoes.txt' file with pop up window showing more details such as name, height etc.
* Population layer classifies the map in to different colors based on the population count in that region based on the info from "world.json" file.
