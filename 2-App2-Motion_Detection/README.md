## App 2: Motion Detection using WebCam

* This app will detect objects in motion using the built-in camera of the laptop.
* The input video is recorded and the objects detected are highlighted in rectangle shape.
* Four output frames such as Gray frame, Delta frame, Threshold frame and Color frame are displayed in separate windows.
* The status of object detection is stored in a list using which the timestamp information when an object entered/exited the camera coverage area is recorded in an excel file. 
* Example excel file named "Times.csv" is present in this folder where an object entered the frame 4 times.
